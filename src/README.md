# Jokes Forum API

## 1. Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app

Problem 1: There are so many jokes that it can be difficult to find and separate the good from the bad. 
Problem 2: It can also be difficult to find good jokes of a particular category.
Problem 3: It is hard to find a creative outlet to contribute jokes.
Problem 4: It can be hard to get feedback for jokes you have created. 
Problem 5: It can be difficult to find a community that likes jokes as much as you do. 

The app allows an easy location to find jokes, listing them by popularity via the upvote system. Tags are utilised to allow an easy way to find the most humerous jokes by category. Comments are also allowed on jokes to allow for user interactions, whether it be to express reactions or give feedback, to further explain the joke, or to even add follow-up jokes.

## 2. Why is it a problem that needs solving?

The problems listed in question 1 require solving for a few reasons. Firstly, everyone can do with more humour in their life. The ability to view jokes by popularity helps to save time in busy lives (instead of having to trawl through lists of unfunny jokes), hopefully adding a bit more joy to people's lives. Secondly, not everyone has the same sense of humour, and the ability to to find top humerous jokes by tags or categories help to overcome that. Thirdly, for those wishing to create jokes it can be difficult to gauge feedback as there may be a limited number of people available, or else the particular community (family or friendship group) may have a different sense of humour. By expanding the reach and audience of the creations, with the option for direct feedback via upvotes and comments, a creator can more efficiently craft their art. Finally, by providing access to a community of like-minded people, and encouraging creativity and interaction, it will help foster greater emotional and social wellbeing. 

## 3. Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?

## 4. Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM

- what does ORM mean? What is it? what does it do?
- what is its functionality?
- what are the benefits of using one?

## 5. Document all endpoints for your API
- there are tools to automate this, may need to write docstrings at top of methods, then a tool can generate it
- include everything frontend would need to know about
- e.g. if need authorization, format, body type ?JSON /XForm ?Binary
- ? what is reponse format ?data types of passed parameters ? parameters to be passed 
- e.g. Flask-autodoc (check documentation for what is expected)

## 6. An ERD for your app


## 7. Detail any third party services that your app will use

- closely mirror ERD. describe in terms of SQLAlchemy/ORM/describe hwo they work

- talk about same, but how a FK constraint would be represented in column of SQLAlchemy field
- can do SQL screenshot and explanation
